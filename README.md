## Project Structure

The project is organized in two main directories: src and dist.

- Src folder
    The src folder contains all the application source files:

    - css: This directory contains all the CSS files used for styling the application.
    - js: This directory contains the main JavaScript file (index.js) that handles the application logic.
    - img: This directory contains all the images used in the application.
    - index.html: This HTML file is the main template of the application. It contains the   basic structure of the user interface and serves as the entry point for loading the application.

- Dist. folder
    The dist folder is intended to contain your application's deployed files, ready to be used in production. It contains:

    - img: This directory contains the application images, which were copied from the src/img directory during the compilation process.
    - bundle.js: This file is the result of compiling the main JavaScript file (index.js). Contains all the application's JavaScript code, ready to run in the browser.
    - index.html: This HTML file is the final version of the application's user interface, ready to be displayed in the browser. May include links to external CSS and JavaScript files, such as bundle.js.
